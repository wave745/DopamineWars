GOAL:
✨ Anyone can land on Dopameter, instantly upload content, instantly vote, instantly react — no login walls, no gatekeeping, all chaos. And the UI? So clean and juicy, it hits harder than a dopamine drip.

🛠️ CORE FEATURES TO BUILD (FOR ENGAGEMENT + OPEN INTERACTION)
1. 🧾 Public Upload Panel (No Login Needed)
What you need:

A form with just 1–2 fields: URL, optional Category

A default user_id = 'anonymous' for guests

Backend Logic:

Create anonymous entries in the posts table

Timestamp and push it to the top of the feed

UX Detail:

After upload, auto-scroll to the top where their content shows

Add a “🎉 Your dopamine drop is live!” toast/alert

2. 🎭 Real-Time Global Feed
What you need:

Fetch posts ordered by created_at DESC

Limit = 30, auto-paginate

Include vote score live

UX Detail:

New uploads animate in with a quick “pulse” effect

Sort switcher: Newest | Trending | 🔥 Highest Rated

3. 🧠 Emoji Voting System (No Auth Needed)
Reactions to Include:

😐 Mid

😊 Mild

😄 Solid

🤯 Brain Melt

🔥 Serotonin Liquidation

Backend Logic:

Each vote stores:

post_id

emoji

Optionally: session ID or IP hash (if you want to prevent spam later)

Aggregate emoji counts per post

Frontend:

Show emoji buttons below each post

Animate when clicked (bounce/pop)

Show real-time tally count for each emoji

Optional: “You voted 🤯 on this” highlight

4. 🚨 Live Dopamine Pulse (Leaderboard & Index)
Dopamine Index: Rolling chart (daily spike tracker)

Leaderboard: Top 5 highest-rated content (by emoji power score)

Pulse Effects:

Green for normal spikes

Red flash for big “Liquidation” moments

Optionally: Mini fire emoji appears on post
